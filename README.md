# _Teamfight Tactics_ - Data Dragon

## Introduction
_Data Dragon_ is a package of files you can use for your projects about [_Teamfight Tactics_](https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com), distributed by Riot Games.

Don't forget that new patchs will be added right after their release on Riot Games' Developers website, but it takes often many days to come.
