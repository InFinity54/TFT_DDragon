# _Teamfight Tactics_ - Data Dragon

Do you want to use DDragon for an another game from _Riot Games_? Check the [_Data Dragon_ repository for _League of Legends_](https://github.com/InFinity54/LoL_DDragon) or the [_Valorant_ one](https://github.com/InFinity54/Valorant_DDragon).

## Introduction
_Data Dragon_ is a package of files you can use for your projects about [_Teamfight Tactics_](https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com), distributed by Riot Games. A new version of Data Dragon is released some days after each new set release. This repository allows you to update automatically all files more easily.

Don't forget that new patchs will be added right after their release on Riot Games' Developers website, but it takes often many days to come. 

## Additional contents in this repository
This repository contains some additional files, not included in Data Dragon :

- Icons of all turbo badges (used for some gamemodes, like _Hyper Roll_ and  _Double Up_)

## Unused contents in this repository
Because of the presence of all previous sets (which can still be downloaded from Riot Games servers), some contents which became unused in _Teamfight Tactics_ are available in this repository. This content can be some deleted elements, or old versions of actual stuff. In the repository, you will find :

- All previous sets of the game
